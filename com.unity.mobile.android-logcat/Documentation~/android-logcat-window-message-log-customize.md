# Customize message log columns

By default, the [message log](android-logcat-window-reference.md#message-log) displays all possible information for messages that Unity receives from Android Logcat. If you don't need to see every type of message information (for example, the process ID or tag), you can change which columns are visible in the message log. This gives you more space to view the information from other columns, which is especially useful for message text that would otherwise need you to scroll horizontally to read it all.

To change which columns are visible, right-click anywhere in the message log header. In the context menu that appears, you can:

* Toggle the visibility of individual columns.
* Hide all columns.
* Show all columns.
