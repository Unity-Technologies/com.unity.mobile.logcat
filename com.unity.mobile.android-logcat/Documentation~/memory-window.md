# Memory window

The Memory window tracks the memory allocated for your application. It can automatically capture memory snapshots for the selected application periodically, but if this affects the application's performance, you can disable automatic capture and instead press a button to capture a memory snapshot manually.

> [!NOTE]
> When the Memory window requests a memory capture, the following message might appear in the Android Logcat window: `Explicit concurrent copying GC freed 5515(208KB) AllocSpace objects, 1(20KB) LOS objects, 49% free, 1926KB/3852KB, paused 46us total 11.791ms`. This is normal and it stops appearing when you disable the Memory window.

This section of the documentation describes the areas and features of the Memory window.
